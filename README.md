## About

This project's goal was to build a browsable list of items that you can filter and access to the details of one item. The list should be accessed from an API, so I choose the [TheMealDB-API][TheMealDB-API] and filtered it to store only meals based on their categories.

Repository: `https://github.com/Ralph-1/The-Sercet-Recipes`

## The catalogue

When you open the catalog the React APP downloads the data from the server using an API and stores it in the Redux store.
- A user can view all the meals categories in the CookBook

- A user can click on any category and get to see the meals listed under that category.

- Under each category, a user sees a variety of dishes to make a choice from and each dish chosen has a list of all the ingredients that were used to prepare it, area where it originates from and the category it belongs to:
